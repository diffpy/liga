Biosphere Genetic Algorithm

Biosphere	array of populations of different molecule kinds
Population	array of molecules of the same kind (same number of atoms)
SandSphere	discrete grid inside a sphere with R=dmax, where atoms
		can be placed, delta = dmax/ngridmax
Molecule	list of atom positions on SandSphere grid,
		individual atom fitnesses, total molecule fitness,
		list of occupied lengths from target distance table
		list of free lengths from target distance table
