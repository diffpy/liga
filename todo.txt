Priority classification:
1   next release
2   as soon as possible
3   nice to have
4   consider including

Conformation search:
1   make it keep the original winner only when it is 2 times better than the
    looser and both of them are above eps, should the same parameter be
    used also for winner cloning?
1   add option for dumping all teams
1   add Reassign pairs operator, that searchs for best assignment of target
    distances
1   check where does Badness() become smaller than BGA::eps_badness
1   prevent LM not converged messages
1   simplify, remove alternative penalty definitions
1   allow starting configuration to have more atoms then natoms
2   implement badness evaluation with permuted atom order
2   try simplex minimization, compare with LM minimizer
2   implement global structure relaxation 
2   get rid of sign-compare warnings
3   make Pair_t lock-able - allow fast molecule copying and destruction
3   come up with a nice library name
4   use fast hash table instead of maps for pairs storage
4   redesign classes - make a base atom and molecule class; molecule should
    be a container of atoms

Input output:
2   add reading of atomeye structure format

Monte Carlo search
1   implement worst-atom relaxation, do benchmarks for Platonic Solids

Other
1   fix dvar.py to include partial contributions
1   make dvar calculation the same as in BGA Molecule,
    add option for comparing sorted list of distances
